# wordsearch-java-tdd
This is my solution to the wordsearch problem issued by Pillar. Some interesting facts that I hope you will consider in the assessment of this application.

- This is my second time working on a java application.
- Before this project I had never used junit.
- I believe there are more opportunities to tune this for performance.
- Whether or not this will adequately pass the codescreen, I would love feedback so that I can grow as a developer.

## Dependencies
Linux/Unix Operating system with bash.
I used Maven, make sure you have it installed.

## Before Running


``` > scripts/build.sh ```

This will install any and all dependencies needed to run this application.


``` > scripts/test.sh ```

These should pass... but is essentially un-necessary


place properly formatted puzzles in .txt format in the "puzzles" directory at the root of this application.

## To Run
``` > scripts/run.sh {puzzlename}.txt```

the default example is pre-provided. Run it like this:


``` > scripts/run.sh puzzle1.txt```
